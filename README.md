# Project Assimov

**Core engine:** `grammarnaut` (also known as `gramaneute`)  

---

## 🧠 What is it?

*Project Assimov* is an experimental architecture for controlled text generation combining:
- Local or remote LLMs
- Symbolic and semantic control
- Modular user-defined rules
- Structured inputs aimed at discourse generation

The central engine, `grammarnaut`, acts as a semiotic compiler that transforms conceptual instructions into optimized prompts for LLMs.
