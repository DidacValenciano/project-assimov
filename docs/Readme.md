# 📚 `docs/` — Documentation & Philosophy

This folder contains the **technical, architectural, philosophical and narrative backbone** of Project Assimov. It gathers system diagrams, role maps, manifestos in multiple languages, exploratory texts, and reflective letters on the nature of language, AI, and pedagogy.

---

## 🧠 Architecture & Role Maps

- `arquitecture.md`: Minimal structural outline of the Assimov system.
- `flux_roles.yaml`: Functional role graph for multimodel text generation (English).
- `flux_roles_cat.yaml`: Catalan version of the above role flow, identical in structure.

---

## ✒️ Exploratory & Conceptual Texts

- `gramaneute.pdf` / `gramaneute.tex`: **Original Catalan essay** introducing the “Gramaneute” — a guiding metaphor for a role that orchestrates LLMs with purpose and structure.
- `grammarnaut.pdf` / `grammarnaut.tex`   : **English adaptation/translation** of `Gramaneute`, describing the "Grammarnaut" as the "good shepherd" of LLMs in narrative form.

---

## 📜 Manifestos

- `manifesto.pdf` / `manifesto.tex`: **International version (USA-focused)** — simplified, rhetorical, English original.
- `manifesto_EU.pdf` / `manifesto_EU.tex`: **European adaptation** — literal English translation of the Catalan manifesto, adapted to European discourse.
- `manifest_cat.pdf` / `manifest_cat.tex`: **Original Catalan manifesto** — stylistic and culturally rooted essay titled *"Projecte Assimov: Un Manifest per a Educadors en l’Era dels Transformers"*.
  Explores the cultural imprint of *Mazinger Z*, *Transformers*, and the emergent symbolic weight of LLMs in education.

## 💌 Open Letter

- `to_the_authors_of_attention_is_all_you_need.pdf` / `.tex`: A poetic and philosophical letter addressed to the original authors of the Transformer architecture.
  It recognizes not only the algorithmic breakthrough but also the **mythic and narrative resonance** behind the term *“Transformer”* — as both an engineering feat and a cultural symbol.

---

## 🌐 Purpose

This directory is not just for documentation.
It is a **repository of vision**: linguistic, narrative, technical and ethical — the kind of groundwork Asimov himself would have appreciated.

> *Where generation meets intention, and structure becomes meaning.*
